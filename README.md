OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT-FRAUD DETECTION IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

OBJECTIVE

To develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. The goal is to ensure accurate anomaly detection, reduce false positives, and enhance security in financial systems using algorithms like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and deep learning models.

KEY ACTIVITIES

Data Collection: Gather transaction data from financial systems.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale features, and address class imbalance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze patterns and identify anomalies.
Model Development: Implement machine learning models for fraud detection.
Model Training and Evaluation: Optimize model performance with appropriate metrics.
System Deployment: Deploy the model in real-time for live transaction monitoring.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Update and refine models with new data.

TECHNOLOGY USED

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
